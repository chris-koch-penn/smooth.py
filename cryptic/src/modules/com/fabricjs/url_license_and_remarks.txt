You can drop-in replace fabric.js by another custom build, including more features. You can use those new features directly from Transcrypt.

Interaction needs to be included in the (dev) download, otherwise canvas will be missing.
Look for !!! in this modified copy of fabric.js to find a fix for a warning from Google's closure compiler.
