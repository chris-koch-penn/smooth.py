This example consists of two Transcrypt applications, 'cats' and 'dogs', running on the same page.
They share one instance of the runtime library and of the 'animals' module.

Compile this example by the following commands:

transcrypt cats
transcrypt dogs


Then start a local web server, e.g. the server that comes with node.js:

http-server D:/activ_tosh/geatec/transcrypt/qquick/Transcrypt/transcrypt/development/manual_tests/dyn_units/animals -p8080 -c-1

Open a browser and go to localhost:8080/animals.html to play with the result.
